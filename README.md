 PCC Computer Science Dept. Discord Community Guidelines


The PCC Computer Science Department Discord Server is an extension of Portland Community College. As such, the Core COC of PCC extends to this Discord server. You can view this here 

[https://www.pcc.edu/student-conduct/conduct/student-code-of-conduct-policy-and-procedures/]

As well as the Core COC of PCC, the server will have a COC related to the computer science department's needs to keep this platform a positive learning environment. 

Failure to follow the COC of PCC and the extended rules of this server will result in engagement from PCC faculty and will be treated as an on-campus incident. 

It is **ok** to have a technical disagreement with a fellow student. It is **not ok** to degrade someone or their work. 
Slurs used **in any context** are prohibited.
Politically views **in any context** are prohibited.
Job posting **unless from or approved by a faculty member** is prohibited.
